Multinomial Dirichlet model for Ecological Inference in RxC tables

Syntax
+++++

Unlike other EI models in Zelig, in the :math:`RxC` case, all the row and column variables need to specified.  Let's assume :math:`C1` through :math:`CC` are the column totals, and :math:`R1` through :math:`RR` are the row totals, and :math:`N=R1_i + R2_i + \ldots + RR_i = C1_i + C2_i + \ldots + CC_i` is the total in unit :math:`i`.  In the case with three row variables and three column variables, the syntax is:

.. {r, eval = FALSE}
z.out <- zelig( cbind(C1,C2,C3) ~ cbind(R1,R2,R3), data=data)
.. ..

Additionally, if ``C1``, ``C2``, ``R1``, ``R2`` are percentages rather than counts, then either formula method above is acceptable, however, you must also provide ``N`` the unit totals as:

.. {r, eval = FALSE}
z.out <- zelig( cbind(C1,C2,C3) ~ cbind(R1,R2,R3), N=N, data=data)
.. ..

The argument ``N`` can be either a numeric vector of the total in each *i*-th unit, or the character name of a variable in the dataset that contains these values.


First load packages:

.. {r, eval = FALSE}
library("Zelig")
library("ZeligEI")
.. ..

Here is an example of all the syntax for the analysis using the first syntax method, and the direct use of the reference classes:

.. {r, eval = FALSE}
z5 <- zeirxc$new()
z5$zelig(C1 ~ R1, N=myN, weights = w, data = myData)
z5$setx()
z5$sim()
.. ..

With the Zelig 4 compatibility wrappers this looks like:

.. {r, eval = FALSE}
z.out <- zelig(C1 ~ R1, N=N, model = "eihier", weights = w, data = myData)
x.out <- setx(z.out)
s.out <- sim(z.out, x = x.out)
.. ..

Examples
+++++

.. {r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}	
rm(list=ls(pattern="\\.out"))
suppressWarnings(suppressMessages(library(ZeligEI)))
set.seed(1234)
.. .. 

We'll use a dataset from the ``eiPack`` package, of registration data for White, Black, and Native American voters, and party voteshare, in 277 precincts in eight counties of south-eastern North Carolina in 2001.
.. {r, eval = TRUE}	
library("eiPack", quietly=TRUE)
data(senc)
.. ..

Here is the model estimated in Zelig.
.. {r, eval = TRUE}	
z.out <- zeirxc$new()
z.out$zelig(cbind(dem, rep, non) ~ cbind(black, white, natam), N="total", data = senc)
summary(z.out)
.. ..

You can check for convergence before summarizing the estimates with three diagnostic tests.  See the section :ref:`Diagnostics for Zelig Models <diagnostics>` for more examples of these tests, and interpretation of their meaning.  For brevity we only show the first set of parameters, the :math:`\alpha`'s, as there are twice as many :math:`\beta`'s as there are precincts:

.. {r, eval = TRUE}
gd <- z.out$geweke.diag()
print(gd[[1]])
hd <- z.out$heidel.diag()
print(hd[[1]])
rd <-z.out$raftery.diag()
print(rd[[1]])
.. ..
